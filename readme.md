# Akari

In this assignment, I used the model-view-controller design pattern together with the JavaFX UI library to design a complete, functioning GUI implementation of the single-player logic puzzle akari. https://www.puzzle-light-up.com/. Users are able to play Akari in a pop-up window and solve a variety of built-in puzzles.

Thanks for reading!
